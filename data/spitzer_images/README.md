# *Spitzer* IRAC1 (3.6 micron) Images (data, mask, PSF)

The data images have been converted to integrated counts (ADU) per pixel.

The NGC 4608 images are based on the pipeline-generated MAIC mosaic images
from the [*Spitzer* Legacy Archive](http://sha.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Spitzer/SHA/), 
with a pixel scale of 0.6 arcsec.

The NGC 4643 images are based on the [S4G-generated mosaic images](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/S4G/), 
with a pixel scale of 0.75 arcsec and standard (N = up, E = left) astronomical
orientation.

The PSF images are based on the [in-flight Point Response Funtion files](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/calibrationfiles/psfprf/),
downsampled to the appropriate pixel scales.
